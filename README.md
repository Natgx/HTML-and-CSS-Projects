# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is my repository that will contain all my projects in my HTML and CSS Course on my boot camp in Tech Academy.

## Projects
* Space Website
* Movie Theater (Academy Cinemas) Website

### Space Website
This page is an example of a homepage for a website made for Gundam fans, it is a work in progress but for now it containes a navbar, containers for photos, and a form in the end. This site was styled using CSS.
### Movie Theater Website (Academy Cinemas)
This is an example of a Movie Theater website for people who would love to know the time when their favorite movies are showing and who would love to receive rewards in the process. This site was styled using Bootstrap4, using its components like navbar, form, cards, dropdowns, jumbotron, and more.
